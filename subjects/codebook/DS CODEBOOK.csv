ANT,Alert Effect,Alert Effect: Alerting is defined as achieving and maintaining and alert state. The alert effect was calculated by subtracting the mean reaction time of the double-cue conditions from the mean reaction time of the no-cue conditions.,ANT_01,,,,,
,OrientingEffect,"Orienting Effect: Orienting is the selection of information from sensory input.  Orienting is manipulated by presenting a cue indicating where in space a person should attend, thereby providing a basis for the person to direct attention to the cued location either overtly by moving the eyes or covertly without eye movement. The orienting effect was calculated by subtracting the mean reaction time of the spatial cue conditions from the mean reaction time of the center cue.",ANT_02,,,,,

Higher scores mean Individuals are high in neuroticism and therefore have a tendency to experience negative affects such as fear, sadness, embarrassment, anger, guilt, and disgust. They are also prone to irrational ideas, are less able to control their impulses, and tend to cope poorly with stress. Lower scores mean Individuals are low in neuroticism are emotionally stable.

Extraverts are assertive, active, and talkative. They like excitement and stimulation and tend to be cheerful in disposition. They are upbeat, energetic, and optimistic. Lower scores mean Individuals are low in extraversion are reserved, independent, and even-paced. Introverts prefer to be alone. Although they are not given to the exuberant high spirits of extraverts, introverts are not unhappy or pessimistic.",NEOFFI_69,,,,,
,O T- Score,"T Scores are calculated from raw scores based on gender. Higher scores mean Individuals are high in openness to experience tend to have an active imagination, aesthetic sensitivity, attentiveness to inner feelings, preference for variety, intellectual curiosity, and independence of judgment. Open individuals are curious about both inner and outer worlds, and their lives are experientially richer than those of closed individuals. They are willing to entertain novel ideas and unconventional values, and they experience both positive and negative emotions more keenly than do closed individuals. Open individuals are willing to question authority and are prepared to entertain new ethical, social, and political ideas. Lower scores mean Individuals score low on openness to experience tend to be conventional in behavior and conservative in outlook. They prefer the familiar to the novel, and their emotional responses are somewhat muted. Individuals with low scores tend to be socially and politically conservative; this is not be mistaken with intolerance or authoritarian aggression.",NEOFFI_70,,,,,

VINELAND-scoring,REC_RAW,"Raw scores are computed by summing the following items: 1. sum of scores (scores consist of 1’s and 2’s) between the basal and ceiling items; 2. the number of items before the basal multiplied by 2; 3. the number of DK and/or missing items between the basal and ceiling items  (if the total for the subdomain is greater than 2, the subdomain cannot be scored); 4. the number of items scored N/O between the basal and ceiling items. For more information on identifying the basal and ceiling items, please see page 45 in the Vineland-II Manual.",VINESCORES_01,,,,,
,REC_VSCALE,Raw scores are converted to v-scale scores by age using a conversion tables in the Vineland-II Manual. V-scale is a standard score with a mean of 15 and standard deviation of 3 that describes the individual’s relative level of functioning on the subdomains.,VINESCORES_02,,,,,
,REC_90%_CI,A 90% confidence interval for the v-scale score is found using the conversion tables in the Vineland-II Manual.,VINESCORES_03,,,,,
,REC_ADAPT_LEVEL,Adaptive levels describe the individual’s performance using terms that are nearly universal. A v-scale score between 1-9 is a low adaptive level; a score between 10-12 is a moderately low adaptive level; a score between 13-17 is an adequate adaptive level; a score between 18-20 is a moderately high adaptive level; a score between 21-24 is a high adaptive level.,VINESCORES_04,,,,,
,REC_AGE_EQUIV,Raw scores are converted to age equivalent scores using the conversion table in the Vineland-II Manual.  This score represents the age at which the raw score is average.,VINESCORES_05,,,,,
,REC_SW,"This score allows you to evaluate an individual’s strengths and weaknesses by comparing his or her performance on subdomains within a domain.  First, the median of all subscale scores are determined, next each subdomain is subtracted from the median. The subdomain is considered a strength if the difference from the median is greater than or equal to +2. Thus subdomain is considered a weakness if the difference from the median is less than or equal to -2.",VINESCORES_06,,,,,
,EXP_RAW,"Raw scores are computed by summing the following numbers: 1.
