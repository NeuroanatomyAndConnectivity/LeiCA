Orienting is manipulated by presenting a cue indicating where in space a person should attend, thereby providing a basis for the person to direct attention to the cued location either overtly by moving the eyes or covertly without eye movement. The orienting effect was calculated by subtracting the mean reaction time of the spatial cue conditions from the mean reaction time of the center cue.",ANT_02,,,,,

,PTRN_RAW,Identifies forms that may be invalid because the respondent was inattentive to the item content. Scored by tallying the times an item response differs from the response to the previous item. A very low tally indicates the respondent tended to choose the same response option repeatedly when completing the form. A very high tally suggests the respondent might have completed the form in a cyclical pattern. Scores between 66-125 are acceptable; scores between 0-65 shows there were very few changes in item responses; scores between 126-160 shows considerable variation in item responses.,BASCPRSC_57,,,,,

Extraverts are assertive, active, and talkative. They like excitement and stimulation and tend to be cheerful in disposition. They are upbeat, energetic, and optimistic. Lower scores mean Individuals are low in extraversion are reserved, independent, and even-paced. Introverts prefer to be alone.

Open individuals are curious about both inner and outer worlds, and their lives are experientially richer than those of closed individuals. They are willing to entertain novel ideas and unconventional values, and they experience both positive and negative emotions more keenly than do closed individuals. Open individuals are willing to question authority and are prepared to entertain new ethical, social, and political ideas. Lower scores mean Individuals score low on openness to experience tend to be conventional in behavior and conservative in outlook. They prefer the familiar to the novel, and their emotional responses are somewhat muted. Individuals with low scores tend to be socially and politically conservative; this is not be mistaken with intolerance or authoritarian aggression.",NEOFFI_70,,,,,

For more information on identifying the basal and ceiling items, please see page 45 in the Vineland-II Manual.",VINESCORES_01,,,,,
